## Our Commitment to Trust

At Growth Pulse, we believe in **radical transparency** about how we use artificial intelligence in our research, analysis, and content creation. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, we're committed to maintaining the trust of our readers through honesty, human oversight, and clear disclosure.

## How We Use AI

### ✅ What AI Helps Us With

- **Research & Monitoring:** AI tools scan thousands of sources to identify emerging growth marketing trends, campaign data, and industry research
- **Data Analysis:** Processing metrics, statistics, and trends from marketing industry reports
- **Content Structuring:** Organizing information into readable formats
- **Grammar & Style:** Basic proofreading and editorial consistency

### ❌ What Humans Do (No AI Involved)

- **Final Editorial Decisions:** All stories are reviewed and approved by human editors
- **Fact-Checking:** Every claim is verified by our editorial team
- **Context & Analysis:** Human editors provide interpretation, nuance, and strategic insight
- **Ethical Judgments:** Decisions about sensitive topics or controversial coverage
- **Voice & Tone:** The editorial personality and humor you read is human-crafted

## Our Human-in-the-Loop Process

```
AI Research Assistant → Human Writer → AI Grammar Check → 
Human Editor Review → Fact-Checker → Human Final Approval → 
Transparency-Labeled Publication
```

**Key Principle:** AI assists, humans decide. Every article is reviewed by at least two human editors before publication.
